These agents are utilized to mask undesirable flavors in food and beverages, particularly in products that use plant-based proteins or other raw ingredients that may impart strong or off-putting tastes. The growing trend of health-conscious consumers and the rise of dietary preferences such as veganism, vegetarianism, and flexitarianism are pushing food producers to develop more innovative, flavorful products with soy masking agents at the forefront. The demand is also being driven by soy’s wide availability and its ability to provide functional properties such as emulsification, texture improvement, and flavor enhancement. As consumer interest in plant-based diets grows, the adoption of soy-based solutions is poised to increase, especially in regions such as North America and Europe, where these dietary preferences are more pronounced. Additionally, emerging markets in Asia-Pacific are also contributing to the global growth of the soy masking agents market, driven by an expanding middle-class population and rising awareness of plant-based nutrition. Moreover, advancements in food processing technologies are enabling companies to better capture and utilize soy-derived masking agents to enhance product quality, which will further fuel market growth.
